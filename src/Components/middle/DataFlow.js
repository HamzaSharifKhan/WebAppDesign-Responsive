                                   Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.
                                   Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objectsâ€”the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth.
